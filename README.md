# Image-Quality-Assessment-for-Fake-Biometric-Detection-MATLAB
Image Quality Assessment for Fake Biometric Detection: Application to Iris, Fingerprint, and Face Recognition In this project, propose a novel software-based fake detection method that can be used in multiple biometric systems to detect different types of fraudulent access attempts. The objective of the proposed system is to enhance the security of biometric recognition frameworks, by adding liveness assessment in a fast, user-friendly, and non-intrusive manner, through the use of image quality assessment. The proposed approach presents a very low degree of complexity, which makes it suitable for real-time applications. This method using 25 general image quality features extracted from one image to distinguish between legitimate and impostor samples.
